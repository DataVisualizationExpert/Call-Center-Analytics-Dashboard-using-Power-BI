**##Call Center Analytics in Power BI
**
Boost agent performance and improve customer satisfaction with interactive dashboards.

This repository showcases my portfolio project, built using Power BI Desktop and Excel during my internship at PwC. It leverages call center data to provide data-driven insights into agent performance, call trends, and customer experience.

**Key Features:**
Agent Performance: Track individual and team performance metrics like average call handling time, call resolution rate, and customer satisfaction ratings.
Call Trends: Analyze call volume by time of day, day of week, and agent. Identify peak periods and optimize resource allocation.
Customer Experience: Uncover patterns in customer feedback and identify areas for improvement.
Interactive Dashboards: Visualize data through various charts and graphs, enabling easy exploration and analysis.
